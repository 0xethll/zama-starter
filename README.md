# Zama Starter - A Practical FHE DApp

This project demonstrates practical implementation of confidential token operations using Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology. Building upon the OpenZeppelin Confidential Contracts v0.1.0 framework, it provides a seamless bridge between traditional ERC20 tokens and their confidential counterparts.

## Key Features

-   **Confidential Token Wrapping/Unwrapping**: Secure conversion between public ERC20 tokens and confidential tokens while preserving privacy
-   **Private Token Transfers**: Execute confidential token transfers with encrypted balances and amounts
-   **Optimized UX**: Extensive frontend optimizations and edge case testing to deliver a familiar Web3 experience for users accustomed to non-confidential dApps

## Technical Implementation

-   Smart contracts built on OpenZeppelin Confidential Contracts v0.1.0
-   Next.js frontend with comprehensive UI/UX optimizations

This represents my second Zama project, focusing on practical utility rather than basic syntax learning. The emphasis on frontend polish and user experience demonstrates how FHE technology can be made accessible to mainstream Web3 users without compromising the underlying privacy guarantees.

## Future Roadmap

-   Migration to OpenZeppelin Confidential Contracts v0.2.0
-   Exploration of additional confidential contract use cases and applications
